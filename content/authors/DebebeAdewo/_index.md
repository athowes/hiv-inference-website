Debebe Shaweno is a postdoc working on developing new Bayesian spatiotemporal methods for HIV burden estimation at more granular spatial units. His interest lies in integrating spatio-temporal methods with mathematical models to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, especially TB and HIV. After completing PhD at the university of Melbourne in 2019, he worked at the University of Sheffield as a research associate in infectious disease modelling applying mathematical models and inference frameworks to interpret results of randomised community trials of joint interventions of tuberculosis and HIV in high TB/HIV burden settings.

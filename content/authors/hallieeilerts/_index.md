Hallie is a PhD student in Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, supervised by Georges Reniers, Jeff Eaton, and Julio Romero Prieto. Her research focuses on examining bias and uncertainty in under-five mortality estimates for sub-Saharan Africa, and the potential of using individual-level record linkage between demographic surveillance sites and antenatal clinics to improve estimates.

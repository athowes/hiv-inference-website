My name is Kate Bilsborrow and I’ve worked at Imperial for nearly ten years. I’m
an Admin Assistant and part of my job is to manage Jeff Eaton’s portfolio of
grants. Before I worked at Imperial, I was a Grants Manager at the Harvard
School of Public Health in Boston, where I lived for six years. I have a BA in
English Language and Literature from Oxford and in my spare time, I enjoy
reading, travelling and spending time with my husband Jeff and seven-year-old
son John.

My work centres on identifying risk groups with high HIV incidence among general
populations in sub-Saharan Africa, currently based on two approaches: (1)
finding measurable determinants that can efficiently quantify individual risks,
and (2) estimating HIV incidence from latest antenatal clinics data. Findings
are expected to inform HIV prevention programmes on where and whom services
should be provided for.

Building up on the interest in infectious disease modelling, I am currently
pursuing a PhD in Population Health Sciences at The Center for Communicable
Disease Dynamics, hoping to understand infectious disease dynamics and
determinants that would enable incidence forecasting.

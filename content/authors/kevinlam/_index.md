I am working on the geospatial framework that models the accessibility of people living with HIV to ART facilties in Malawi and identifying underserved locations where new health facilities may be built. I am currently also developing estimates of the male circumcision prevalence in Malawi.

I have recently started my [PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/). My research interests involve working on statistical methodology in Bayesian statistics and statistical learning with the eventual goal of being applied in practice.

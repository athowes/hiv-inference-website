I am a Research Assistant and PhD student working with the [Manicaland Centre for Public Health Research](http://www.manicalandhivproject.org/); a major collaborative HIV/STD prevention research initiative based in Manicaland, east Zimbabwe.

The Manicaland Centre hosts a population-based, open cohort survey investigating the dynamics of HIV transmission and its impact. 

My PhD, co-supervised by Simon Gregson and Jeff Eaton, investigates the need for and use of HIV prevention methods in Zimbabwe using data from a pilot study, run by The Manicaland Centre for Public Health Research, developed to populate the HIV Prevention Cascade framework.

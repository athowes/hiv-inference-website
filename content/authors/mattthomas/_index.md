Matt is a Lecturer in Environmental Intelligence at the Met Office and University of Exeter's Joint Centre of Excellence in Environmental Intelligence. He is also a Visiting Researcher in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. His research interests lie in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics and the implementation of Bayesian hierarchical models with applications in the environment and public health. Matt's current research within the HIV Inference Group include estimating district-level circumcision rates and coverage in sub-Saharan Africa and modelling facility-level attendance for anti-retroviral treatment in Malawi.

Oli Stevens is a Research Assistant and PhD student in the HIV Inference Group within the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology (PI: Jeff Eaton).

After fleeing the horror of cellular biology and lab work, he has found research interests in modelling district-level fertility, the dynamics of antenatal care seeking, and estimating HIV indicators in key populations. His PhD focuses on the HIV epidemic in Mozambique.

He holds a Masters in Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry from the University of Oxford, and a Masters in Public Health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

title: "Naomi: A New Modelling Tool for Estimating HIV Epidemic Indicators at the District Level in Sub-Saharan Africa"
subtitle: ""
summary: >
  The Naomi model synthesizes multiple subnational data sources to furnish
    estimates of key indicators for HIV programme planning, resource allocation,
    and target setting. Further model development to meet evolving HIV policy
    priorities and programme need should be accompanied by continued
    strengthening and understanding of routine health system data.

  **Introduction:** HIV planning requires granular estimates for the number of
    people living with HIV (PLHIV), antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage and
    unmet need, and new HIV infections by district, or equivalent subnational
    administrative level. We developed a Bayesian small-area estimation model,
    called Naomi, to estimate these quantities stratified by subnational
    administrative units, sex, and five-year age groups.
  
  **Methods:** Small-area regressions for HIV prevalence, ART coverage and HIV
    incidence were jointly calibrated using subnational household survey data on
    all three indicators, routine antenatal service delivery data on HIV
    prevalence and ART coverage among pregnant women, and service delivery data
    on the number of PLHIV receiving ART. Incidence was modelled by
    district-level HIV prevalence and ART coverage. Model outputs of counts and
    rates for each indicator were aggregated to multiple geographic and
    demographic stratifications of interest. The model was estimated in an
    empirical Bayes framework, furnishing probabilistic uncertainty ranges for
    all output indicators. Example results were presented using data from Malawi
    during 2016-2018.

  **Results:** Adult HIV prevalence in September 2018 ranged from 3.2% to 17.1%
   across Malawi's districts and was higher in southern districts and in
   metropolitan areas. ART coverage was more homogenous, ranging from 75% to
   82%. The largest number of PLHIV was among ages 35 to 39 for both women and
   men, while the most untreated PLHIV were among ages 25 to 29 for women and 30
   to 34 for men. Relative uncertainty was larger for the untreated PLHIV than
   the number on ART or total PLHIV. Among clients receiving ART at facilities
   in Lilongwe city, an estimated 71% (95% CI, 61% to 79%) resided in Lilongwe
   city, 20% (14% to 27%) in Lilongwe district outside the metropolis, and 9%
   (6% to 12%) in neighbouring Dowa district. Thirty-eight percent (26% to 50%)
   of Lilongwe rural residents and 39% (27% to 50%) of Dowa residents received
   treatment at facilities in Lilongwe city.

  **Conclusions:** The Naomi model synthesizes multiple subnational data sources
    to furnish estimates of key indicators for HIV programme planning, resource
    allocation, and target setting. Further model development to meet evolving
    HIV policy priorities and programme need should be accompanied by continued
    strengthening and understanding of routine health system data.

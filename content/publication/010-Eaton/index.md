abstract: |
  Assuming assays perform at baseline thresholds for WHO prequalification, the
  positive predictive value for the current 2-test strategy will be below 99%,
  implying greater than 1 out of every people diagnosed with HIV are actually
  HIV negative. Adopting the WHO 2019 recommended strategy increases the
  positive predictive value above 99.9% (fewer than 1 in 1000 false positive).
  
  The cost of the implementing the 3-test strategy compared to the 2-test
  strategy is negligible, because very few of the third test (A3) are used
  compared to the first test (A1). The main driver of HIV testing programme
  costs is the number of HIV negative people tested (who do not proceed past
  A1), not the cost for diagnosing an HIV positive person.

summary: >
  This paper analyses the implications of the new WHO 2019 testing strategy
  for positive predictive value, number of misdiagnoses, and cost of the
  three-test versus the two-test strategy. We used HIV testing rates from
  Malawi (estimated using Shiny90) to provide a worked applied example.

summary: >
  Circumcision coverage increased in all districts, however increases were not
    uniform. The largest increases were found in the districts/provinces with
    the largest HIV burden for example KwaZulu-Natal. uMgungundlovu, Umzinyathi,
    and Uthukela were estimated to increase MC coverage of over 45% (absolute
    change) in men aged 15-49 between 2008 and 2020.
